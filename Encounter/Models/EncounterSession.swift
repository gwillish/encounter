//  EncounterSession.swift
//  Encounter
//
//  Runtime models for a live Daggerheart encounter.
//  These are the mutable, in-play tracking types — separate from the
//  static catalog definitions in Adversary.swift.
//
//  Design notes:
//  - EncounterSession is @Observable so SwiftUI views bind to it directly.
//  - AdversarySlot and EnvironmentSlot are structs stored in the session's
//    arrays; mutations flow through the session class.
//  - Fear and Hope are tracked on the session; individual adversary stress
//    contributes to Fear when thresholds are crossed (GM's discretion).
//  - The `activeSlotID` drives spotlight management in the UI.
