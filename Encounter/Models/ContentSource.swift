import Foundation

/// A registered content source for community adversary and environment packs.
///
/// Sources come in two flavours:
/// - **Remote** — a version-pinned URL (see ADR-0017). The user adds a URL;
///   `ContentStore` fetches and caches the pack. Refresh is user-initiated with
///   exponential backoff on failures (see ADR-0027).
/// - **Local import** — a `.dhpack` file opened from Files, AirDrop, or Mail.
///   `url` is `nil`. The pack content is written to disk and reloaded on every
///   launch exactly like a remote source. Removal requires explicit user action
///   (tracked in a separate issue; `ContentStore.removeSource(id:)` is the API).
///
/// ## Persistence
/// The array of registered `ContentSource` values is stored in
/// `Application Support/gwillish.Encounter/sources/index.json`.
/// The pack content itself lives in
/// `Application Support/gwillish.Encounter/sources/<id>/`.
///
/// ## Date fields
/// All `Date` properties are stored as ISO8601 Zulu strings per ADR-0013.
