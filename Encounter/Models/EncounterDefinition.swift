//  EncounterDefinition.swift
//  Encounter
//
//  A saveable, shareable encounter template.
//  Captures the GM's prep work: which adversaries and environments to include,
//  which players are at the table, and any notes.
//
//  To run an encounter, create an EncounterSession from a definition
//  using EncounterSession.start(from:using:).
//
//  Catalog vs. Runtime Split:
//  - Definition stores adversary/environment IDs (references into the Compendium).
//  - Session resolves those IDs into live AdversarySlot and EnvironmentSlot
//    instances with mutable HP, Stress, and condition tracking.
